                <br>

                <br>
                ii. Verification Process: We are required by law to verify the identities of those who submit requests to know or to delete. To determine whether the individual making the request is the consumer about whom we have collected information, we will verify your identity by matching the identifying information provided by you in the request to the Personal Information that we already maintain about you. As a part of this process, you will be required to provide your name and email address, and mobile number (if the same have been voluntarily provided by you at the time of registering on the Platform or otherwise while using the Platform).

                <br>
                If we cannot verify the identity of the person making a request to delete, we may deny the request. If there is no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor to the degree of certainty required, we will state this in our response and explain why we have no reasonable method by which we can verify the identity of the requestor.

                iv. Excessive Requests: If requests from a User are manifestly unfounded or excessive, in particular because of their repetitive character, we may either (1) charge a reasonable fee, or (2) refuse to act on the request and notify the User of the reason for refusing the request. If we charge a fee, the amount will be based upon the administrative costs of providing the information or communication or taking the action requested.
